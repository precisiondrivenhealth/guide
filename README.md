# Health Data Science in Aotearoa New Zealand: A Practical Guide

This is a live resource initially produced by the Precision Driven Health partnership, a health data science collaboration in Aotearoa New Zealand from 2016-2023. Te Whatu Ora now hosts this guide on behalf of the NZ health system.

It is a repository for guidance and suggestions for undertaking data science projects using health data, and is aimed not only at data scientists but also clinicians/health experts, and their colleagues.
